# goFish-simulator-cs
This program simulates a game of go-fish between several automated players.
I originally wrote this as an assignment for a class at Lake Washington Tech, which is why LWTech appears in the namespaces.  Classes in the file LWTech.PlayingCardSimulation.cs came from the class website (with possibly a few minor modifications).  The code in the file GoFish.cs was written by me.
